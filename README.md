Data Integration Layer for Wearable Data

This repository contains a Python script (data_integration.py) designed to simulate the integration of wearable data (steps, heart rate, sleep hours, and HRV). The script reads data from a mock dataset and normalizes it into a structured format (JSON).

Installation

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-integration-layer.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd data-integration-layer

Install the required dependencies (if any). For example:

    pip install pandas

Usage

    Run the Python script to integrate and normalize the data:

    python data_integration.py

    The script will process the mock dataset and output the normalized health metrics in a JSON format.

Input

The script uses a mock dataset containing health metrics for a user (user_id: 12345). The mock dataset is structured as follows:

{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "metrics": [
    {
      "date": "2024-11-22",
      "steps": 8500,
      "heart_rate": 75,
      "sleep_hours": 6.5,
      "hrv": 45
    },
    {
      "date": "2024-11-21",
      "steps": 9500,
      "heart_rate": 72,
      "sleep_hours": 7.2,
      "hrv": 50
    }
  ]
}

This mock dataset contains:

    steps: Number of steps taken on that day.
    heart_rate: User's heart rate.
    sleep_hours: Hours of sleep.
    hrv: Heart rate variability (a measure of fitness and recovery).

Output

The script processes the data and generates a normalized JSON output that can be used by other parts of the system. The output file will look like this:

{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "metrics": [
    {
      "date": "2024-11-22",
      "steps": 8500,
      "heart_rate": 75,
      "sleep_hours": 6.5,
      "hrv": 45
    },
    {
      "date": "2024-11-21",
      "steps": 9500,
      "heart_rate": 72,
      "sleep_hours": 7.2,
      "hrv": 50
    }
  ]
}
